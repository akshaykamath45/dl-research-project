# üïäÔ∏è Bird Species Classification Project

##  Project Overview
This project aims to classify bird species using deep learning techniques. Our dataset includes 400 bird species with separate training, validation, and test sets. We are implementing and comparing various models to achieve the best classification performance.

## üìù Current Status
### Completed Models
1. **VGG16** (With Augmentation)  
2. **Inception V3**

### Models Currently in Progress
- **Custom CNN**

### Remaining Models to Implement
1. CNN No Augmentation  
2. CNN With Augmentation  
3. CNN Augmentation + Dropout  
4. VGG16 (No Augmentation)  
5. ResNet 50 (With Augmentation)  
6. EfficientNet B0 (No Augmentation)  
7. VGG19  
8. YOLO V5  
9. Extra Models (Transformers, LLMs, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Train a New Model
### Step 1: Use Existing Code as Reference
- Refer to the implementation of **VGG16** or **Inception V3** in the repository.
- Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters based on the model to be implemented.

### Step 2: Get Assistance
- Use prompts in tools like Claude or GPT with the existing code snippets to guide you.
- Ask for guidance on architecture or augmentation tweaks.

### Step 3: Modify Augmentations/Parameters
- Experiment with augmentation techniques, learning rates, and optimizers as necessary.
- Feel free to fine-tune the parameters for optimal performance.

### Step 4: Train the Model
- Use **Kaggle Notebooks** for training:
  1. Visit [this private dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/5bc6d82a2bd2ac97d7362a0f2e8b3a19e4ff882b6c112fef14f2de1d82b5c1fe).
  2. Click **Create Notebook**.
  3. Add the required dependencies and start training.
