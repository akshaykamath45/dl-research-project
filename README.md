# üïäÔ∏è Bird Species Classification Project

# Project Overview
This project aims to classify bird species using deep learning techniques. Our dataset includes 400 bird species with separate training, validation, and test sets. We are implementing and comparing various models to achieve the best classification performance.

## üìù Current Status
### Completed Models
1. **VGG16 (With Augmentation) - by Karitkey**
2. **Inception V3 - by Kartikey**
3. **Xception - by Kartikey**
4. **EfficientNet B0 - By Akshay**
5. **VGG19 - By Sridhar Sir**

### Models Currently in Progress
6. **Custom CNN - Akshay**
7. **ResNet 50 - Sridhar Sir**

### Remaining Models to Implement
8. Transformer Model (Swine)

If any issues, we can try extra:

10. CNN without Augmentation  
11. VGG16 without Augmentation

## ‚úÖ Important Checklist
- [ ] Upload the trained model files to GitHub.
- [ ] Create a `predict` function that allows users to select a model from available options.
- [ ] Ensure that corresponding predictions, statistics, and charts are displayed as output.
- [ ] Create frontend on streamlit
- [ ] Start with research paper documentation.

## Results Update  
After training the model, update the results in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUdKqsk9g5wEijbWiCzT49-3nQKj0M20Q0oy7t6vYPU/edit?tab=t.0).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Train a New Model
### Step 1: Use Existing Code as Reference
- Refer to the implementation of **VGG16** or **Inception V3** in the repository.
- Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters based on the model to be implemented.

### Step 2: Get Assistance
- Use prompts in tools like Claude or GPT with the existing code snippets to guide you.
- Ask for guidance on architecture or augmentation tweaks.

### Step 3: Modify Augmentations/Parameters
- Experiment with augmentation techniques, learning rates, and optimizers as necessary.
- Feel free to fine-tune the parameters for optimal performance.

### Step 4: Train the Model
- Use **Kaggle Notebooks** for training:
  1. Visit [this private dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/5bc6d82a2bd2ac97d7362a0f2e8b3a19e4ff882b6c112fef14f2de1d82b5c1fe).
  2. Click **Create Notebook**.
  3. Add the required dependencies and start training.
